# PR Assist
PR Assist is a web browser extension that helps you create better pull requests on Github faster and smoothly through simple steps

## Step 1
PR Assist will ask you to input the issue number associated to the pull request.
This is to keep track of development as it will append the necessary keyword to [link it to an existing issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) on Github

## Step 2
PR Assist will populate the pull request description with a comprehensive template where you can modify as you wish.
The template it provides will help you fill out important details regarding the pull request including summary of your changes, issue link, context of the issue, etc.

1. View and change the default values used to assist your PR including title, description, labels, and checklist templates
2. Dynamic PR templates based on the type of pull request
3. Assisting on maintaining pull requests after they have been created
